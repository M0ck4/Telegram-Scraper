# Version 2.1

<b>tldr</b>: Adds accounts via phone number and API. If you want to add accounts only via phone, then scroll to the end. If you want more free projects like this, then please support me!

# Update Features

- Fixed bug with scraping. You can now scrape from public groups of any size.
- Fixed bug with addbyid.py. You can now start adding by IDs again.

 Features

* ADDS IN BULK[by username]
* Scrapes and adds to public groups
* Adds 50-60 members on an average
* Works in Windows systems
* You can run unlimited accounts at the same time in order to add members
* CSV files auto-distributer based on number of accounts to use
* Powerful scraping tool that can scrape active members from any public group
* You can add members both by username and by user ID
* Least chances of account ban
* Script auto-joins public group from all accounts for faster adding
* Filters banned accounts and remove them, making things easy
